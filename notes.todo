# Bugs
	[ ] Keypad Enter shows as "Null" in bindings
	[ ] Ctrl+; and Ctrl+Shift+; do not work as bindings for some reason?
	[ ] 

# Tweak Requests
	[ ] Keypad enter works for Goto Line submit (maybe other things too?)
	[ ] Highlight matching parenthesis to left of cursor rather than right
	[ ] Why do feed_queue_info/warning/error take String8 pointers? (not just String8)
	[ ] 

# Feature Requests
	[ ] Allow for at least 2 bindings per command (ideally infinite bindings)
	[ ] Allow for unbinding a command that has a binding by default
